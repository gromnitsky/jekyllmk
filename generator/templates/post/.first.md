Every post that location starts w/ `#/YYYY/MM/DD/`, for example,
`#/2100/01/02/` is generated on the fly from a corresponding .md file,
e.g. `2100/01/02/file.md`.

If you have any other files in the directory where your .md file is,
construct links to them relative to that directory. For instance,
inserting an image would be:

	<img src="sense-and-sensibility.png">

Exactly like this one:

<img src="sense-and-sensibility.png">

If you want some formulas in the page & you don't want to modify
`production/site/index.html` file, write `<script>` tags in the .md
file.

## Configuration

`config.json`.

The value of avatar property is an image file name that can be a local
file name or any URI.

## Styling

Modify `local.css` file. Class names et al. are in
`production/site/widgets.css`.
